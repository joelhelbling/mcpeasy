# MCPEasy

A Ruby gem that provides multiple Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for integrating with AI assistants like Claude Code. Each MCP server provides programmatic access to popular web services and APIs.

## Installation

Install the gem globally:

```bash
gem install mcpeasy
```

This makes the `mcpz` command available system-wide for both CLI usage and MCP server configuration.

## Available MCP Servers

This gem includes the following MCP servers, each providing both CLI and MCP server functionality:

### üó£Ô∏è [Slack](./lib/utilities/slack/)
Post messages to Slack channels and list available channels.
- CLI: Direct message posting with custom usernames
- MCP: Integration for AI assistants to send Slack notifications

### üìÖ [Google Calendar](./lib/utilities/gcal/)
Access and search Google Calendar events.
- CLI: List events, search by date range, view calendar information
- MCP: AI assistant access to calendar data and event search

### üìÇ [Google Drive](./lib/utilities/gdrive/)
Search and retrieve files from Google Drive with automatic format conversion.
- CLI: Search files, list recent files, retrieve content
- MCP: AI assistant access to Drive files and documents

### üé• [Google Meet](./lib/utilities/gmeet/)
Find and manage Google Meet meetings from your calendar.
- CLI: List meetings, search by content, get meeting URLs
- MCP: AI assistant access to upcoming meetings and direct links

## Quick Start

### 1. Configuration Setup

Configure your API credentials for each service you plan to use:

```bash
# For Slack
mcpz slack set_bot_token xoxb-your-slack-token

# For Google services (Calendar, Drive, Meet)
mcpz google auth
```

Credentials are stored securely in `~/.config/mcpeasy/` (see individual server documentation for specific setup requirements).

### 2. CLI Usage

Each MCP server can be used directly from the command line:

```bash
# Slack
mcpz slack post general "Hello from Ruby!"

# Google Calendar  
mcpz gcal events --start "2024-01-01"

# Google Drive
mcpz gdrive search "quarterly report"

# Google Meet
mcpz gmeet upcoming
```

### 3. MCP Server Configuration

For use with Claude Code, add servers to your `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "slack": {
      "command": "mcpz",
      "args": ["slack", "mcp"]
    },
    "gcal": {
      "command": "mcpz", 
      "args": ["gcal", "mcp"]
    },
    "gdrive": {
      "command": "mcpz",
      "args": ["gdrive", "mcp"]
    },
    "gmeet": {
      "command": "mcpz",
      "args": ["gmeet", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Development

### Setup

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd mcpeasy
   bundle install
   ```

2. Create configuration directories (if not automatically created):
   ```bash
   # Run manually during development
   bundle exec ruby -r "./lib/mcpeasy/setup" -e "Mcpeasy::Setup.create_config_directories"
   
   # Or use the CLI command after building the gem locally
   bin/mcpz setup
   ```

### Code Quality

Run linting before committing changes:

```bash
bundle exec standardrb
```
